     * @brief A utility base class that prevents derived classes from being moveable.
     *
     * The `NonMoveable` class is designed to be inherited by other classes to disable move
     * construction and move assignment. This is useful for types where moving could lead
     * to incorrect behavior or resource management issues.
     *
     * Usage:
     * - Inherit from `NonMoveable` to automatically delete the move constructor and move
     *   assignment operator in your class.
     * - This class provides a protected default constructor and destructor, allowing derived
     *   classes to be instantiated but not moved.
