     * @brief A utility base class that prevents derived classes from being copyable.
     *
     * The `NonCopyable` class is designed to be inherited by other classes to disable copy
     * construction and copy assignment. This is useful for types where copying would be
     * inappropriate or could lead to resource management issues.
     *
     * Usage:
     * - Inherit from `NonCopyable` to automatically delete the copy constructor and copy
     *   assignment operator in your class.
     * - This class provides a protected default constructor and destructor, allowing derived
     *   classes to be instantiated but not copied.
